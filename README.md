# events app
this is a event booking app for my rental properties. 

created a events database with three collections which are events,partners,payments.

The data folder has been seperated by 3 files partners,events, and payments.

a public folder was created with a style css file within it wich has been linked to the index.js folder

next 3 routes were created containing partners, payments, files were made with focus on events files

within the events 
routers for get, post, patch, and delete were made.

next a views folder was created with an .ejs file to link the form to the style.css file

within the index file express and ejs are called. also here statuses are defined.
